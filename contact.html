<!--As far as psuedo code goes I should explain: My plan was to try to use reusable code and have the articles be the only unique content. I have a reusable header fully functional and styled. I have a reusable side bar that at the time of this writing is partially styled and functional. My articles were intended to be unique to each page and contain the requisite content but I ran out of time. This is not to say I didn't learn quite the contrary I have learned a great deal. If i were to ad more content I need an image table full of links that are images for the portfolio page and for the contacts page I need to set up a few input fields. these fields would be broken right now because I dont have the code to determine what to do with the input right now. Or maybe I do idk I know javascript can do that.
