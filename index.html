				<h2>About Me:</h2>
				<p>Hello, world! My name is Ryan Smith and I am a student learning web developement! I am loving code so far and I am excited to see what kind of projects I will be priveledged to participate in. At the time of this writing I have been introduced to python and javascript and I have some working knowledge in HTML and CSS. The reason code excites me is because it is so enormously empowering not just for myself but for my clients. Creating new things in the digital world that makes the world a better place or just helps create jobs and support small business is something I am looking forward to and I expect to derive a great deal of pride and satisfaction from building all these good things out of code.</p>

<!--As far as psuedo code goes I should explain: My plan was to try to use reusable code and have the articles be the only unique content. I have a reusable header fully functional and styled. I have a reusable side bar that at the time of this writing is partially styled and functional. My articles were intended to be unique to each page and contain the requisite content but I ran out of time. This is not to say I didn't learn quite the contrary I have learned a great deal. If i were to ad more content I need an image table full of links that are images for the portfolio page and for the contacts page I need to set up a few input fields. these fields would be broken right now because I dont have the code to determine what to do with the input right now. Or maybe I do idk I know javascript can do that.-->
